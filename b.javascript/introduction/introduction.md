# How this course will work?
How is this course set up? It starts with a deeper look at the basics. We won’t be focusing deeply on the really basic coding items, so it will move quickly. You should, however, already have completed the Foundations course. The last thing you’ll do is a final project which integrates everything you’ve learned in all the courses of this curriculum. This is the kind of project that you’ll be telling employers all about and a great chance to prove that you’re now, officially, a serious web developer.

There is a lot to cover, but this course has been broken up into bite-sized lessons and their accompanying projects. These projects will give you a chance to apply what you have learned and to show what you are capable of. After a few of them, you’ll really start getting the hang of things.

# A quick review
This course assumes that you have a decent grasp on the fundamentals of JavaScript.

### jQuery?
Before you press on, a note about jQuery. We occasionally get questions about why we don’t include jQuery in our curriculum. jQuery was very popular in the past, but has fallen out of the limelight in recent years. One of the biggest reasons it has begun to fall out of favor is that you simply don’t need it anymore. When it became popular, doing things like DOM manipulation and AJAX calls were difficult in plain JavaScript, but that is no longer the case.

A quick web-search on the topic will be more useful than any explanations here, and if you still want to learn it (many older codebases still use it, and you will see it on many older Stack Overflow posts) we are confident that you can pick it up quite easily by reading the documentation on their website.
