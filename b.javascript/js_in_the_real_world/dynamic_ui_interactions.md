# Dynamic User Interface Interactions
JavaScript is a very powerful language. It is capable of creating complex web applications that work everywhere. But it is just as often used on a smaller scale. JavaScript is the glue that holds even less flashy websites together- it makes drop-downs drop down and image sliders slide.  

Fortunately, at this point, you already have all the tools you need to make these items without resorting to using a bloated framework like bootstrap. (Nothing against bootstrap… you just do not need it! Good for you!)

We aren’t presenting any new content in this lesson - just giving you the chance to practice some of the techniques that you’re going to be using on a daily basis as a JavaScript programmer.

**--) I've created a dropdown menu, mobile tabs menu and an image carousel to practice dynamic interactions. I've published them to the npm registery. They can be accessed from my [npm profile](https://www.npmjs.com/~myinan).**

### Knowledge Check

**Q1.** What are some different types of navigation menus?

**A1.** The main purpose of a navigation menu should be: 1-Highlighting the core functions and 2-Simplifying the user journey.

Tabber, Rectangular, Drawer, Rudder navigation menus are some of the popular design choices that satisfies these 2 requirements.

**Q2.** What are the alternatives to hamburger menus?

**A2.** Hamburger navigation menu design is becoming less and less popular due to its low discoverability and efficiency. Luckily, there are more efficient solutions for this problem. Though it should be said, None of the following design ideas is better than the others, their viability and performance obviously depend on the content and the context.

Tabs, Tabs with a "more" option, Progressively collapsing menus, Scrollable navigations, Dropdown menus are some of the good alternative for hamburger menus.

And sometimes, surprisingly, the hamburger menu might be a good choice. Since the main downside of the hamburger menu is its low discoverability, it’s recommended to consider one of the alternatives when it comes to designing the main navigation menu. However, when designing secondary navigation options, this pattern might be an appropriate solution. If the primary options are available as prominent on-screen call to action buttons, the hamburger menu seems a good place for all the secondary navigation.

**Q3.** What are the downsides of hamburger menus?

**A3.** As explained in the previous answer, hamburger menus hurts UX metrics due of its low discoverability and efficiency. The main idea is that with hamburger menus, discoverability is cut almost in half by hiding a website’s main navigation. Also, task time is longer and perceived task difficulty increases.

Hidden navigation is less discoverable than visible or partially visible navigation. When navigation is hidden, users are less likely to use navigation and if people use hidden navigation, they do so later in the task than if it were visible.
